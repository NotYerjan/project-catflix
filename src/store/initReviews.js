      "It's bonkers in the best possible way. It's silly, laugh-out-loud funny and never takes itself too seriously. For those who have been living on a steady diet of Marvel films, this one delivers hilarious one-liners, jabs and Easter eggs. ",

      "I’m laying down the hammer a bit more harshly because somewhere hidden in this messy pastiche to 80s fantasy movies is an adventure worthy of the gods. Unfortunately, hilarity and humanity fail to harmonize in Thor: Love and Thunder.",

      "By the end, the direction of both the story and the MCU was murkier than before. But at some point all you can do is let the brains at the MCU hive-mind figure it out and then hope they’re able to bring it all together. It’s the best approach.",

      "Throughout all of it, the weird and complex history of Spider-Man as a cinematic icon isn't a hindrance to the story; instead, it's an enhancement, using the quirks of the character's legacy as a source of illumination into why he has endured so long.",
